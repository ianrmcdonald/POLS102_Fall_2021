<div id="course-description" class="section level2">
<h2>Course Description</h2>
<p>What are the prospects for democracy in Egypt, Zimbabwe, or China? Why do countries like Afghanistan, Somalia, and Syria suffer from political instability and violence? Comparative politics seeks to answer these and similar questions by understanding and comparing political behavior and institutions in countries throughout the world.</p>
<p>The goal of this course is to introduce students to the key theoretical frameworks and analytical methods in the field of comparative politics. We will start by asking the question “What are that problems that any effective political system must resolve”? We will then review the three major theoretical lenses in comparative politics by analyzing the extended example of democracy and its causes. While continually drawing on our methodological toolkit throughout the course, we will then analyze a variety of topics such as state-building and ethnic conflict, to name only a few.</p>
<p>Each week we will read a diverse set of articles involving research from different areas of the world. Students will therefore have the chance to expand and hone their comparative as well as analytic thinking skills. Students can expect to read predominantly scholarly articles, but will also be exposed to various materials from the news media or films. Overall, this course should prepare students to engage in comparative politics in a variety of settings, be they academic or otherwise.</p>
<div id="learning-goals" class="section level3">
<h3>Learning Goals</h3>
<p>Learning is an interactive process that requires active engagement by the professor and students. After taking this class students should:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Gain basic fluency in the main concepts and terms of comparative politics (e.g. the state, regime, and nation-state). Understand some of the main ways that societies vary (in their institutions, resources, and culture), and how this variation influences important political, social, or economic outcomes (e.g. form of democratic governance, ethnic conflict, or economic growth).</p></li>
<li><p>Be able to engage meaningfully with and demonstrate knowledge about a region or regions of the world beyond the United States (through reading, writing, conversation, presentation and/or first-hand experiences). Topics of study include historical experience, cultural traditions, past and current social and economic realities, or transnational issues.</p></li>
<li><p>Learn how to use empirically based criteria, rather than just opinion, to assess the merits of a theory or argument. For example, students will learn how to identify the structure of a scholarly argument (“why might X1 <em>cause</em> Y, but X2 would not not cause Y”), and the logic of the argument (“why does X lead to Y?”). Students will learn how to communicate this assessment in both oral and written form.</p></li>
<li><p>Improve, with practice, the ability to craft an argument in written form that is appropriately structured and well written stylistically.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="course-materials" class="section level3">
<h3>Course Materials</h3>
<p>You will need access to a copy of one book:<br />

<h2>Course Expectations</h2>
<div id="reading" class="section level3">
<h3>Reading</h3>
<p>There is generally more than one reading assigned for each day. This is because this class will introduce you to the many voices that make-up the conversation about comparative politics. Additionally, this class will ask you to practice your abilities moving from theory to specific case studies or examples. These readings are short and you should plan to read all of them carefully in their entirety.</p>
<p>Students should be prepared to answer the following three questions each class period:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>What is the main question that animates the reading?<br />
</li>
<li>What case(s) are used to answer the main question?<br />
</li>
<li>In one or two sentences, what is the main answer to the question?</li>
</ol>
<p>You will find to Prof. Gilbert’s reading guides for individual readings here:<br />

</ul>
</div>
<div id="academic-honesty" class="section level3">
<h3>Academic Honesty</h3>
<p>The Lewis &amp; Clark Code of Student Conduct (<a href="https://bit.ly/3sCGwVj" class="uri">https://bit.ly/3sCGwVj</a>) is in force at all times. Note that the consequences for plagiarism and cheating are extremely serious.</p>
<p>Failure to meet the expectations for conduct will result in a reduction of your final grade.</p>
</div>
<div id="accommodation" class="section level3">
<h3>Accommodation</h3>
<p>If you have a disability that may impact your academic performance, you may request accommodations by submitting documentation to the Student Support Services Office in Albany Quadrangle (you can use their online scheduling system to book a Zoom or phone appointment). After you have submitted documentation and filled out paperwork there for the current semester requesting accommodations, staff in that office will notify me of the accommodations for which you are eligible.</p>
</div>
<div id="course-withdrawals" class="section level3">
<h3>Course Withdrawals</h3>
<p>You may drop this course on Webadvisor by Friday, September 10 at 4pm and no W grade will appear on your transcript. From then until 4pm on Friday November 5, you can withdraw from the course by submitting a Course Withdrawal form to the Registrar’s Office. In this case, a W grade will appear on your transcript.</p>
<p>I cannot authorize your withdrawal from the course after November 5. At that point, you will need to complete the course and take whatever grade you have earned. If you have questions or concerns about your performance in the course, please talk with me or write me anytime.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="course-grading" class="section level2">
<h2>Course Grading</h2>
<p><strong>Midterm Exam (20%) and Final Exam (25%)</strong><br />
</p>
<p><strong>Attendance (5%)</strong>  If you are consistently late to class I will begin counting these events as absences and will notify you via email. If you must miss a class session, please notify me (email is fine). Attending consistently is the easiest thing you can do to improve your grade and improve your overall class experience, and not just because of this particular requirement. If you have many absences or must be gone for an extended period of time, I may ask you to document your excuse and I may suggest you to withdraw from the course.<br />
</p>
<p><strong>Participation and Pass/Fail Assignments (5%)</strong>  Throughout the course we will be doing several forms of in-class activity that require active participation: all-class discussion, cohort work, or answering polls or surveys of the class. Group work is very important and active participation during group work is necessary. Throughout the course of the semester there will be pass/fail assignments in which students will apply class themes and topics to a country case of their choosing that will count towards participation.  </p>
<p><strong>Paper 1: Reading Analysis (3-4 page paper) (20%)</strong>  You will be given a scholarly reading in comparative politics. You will be required to identify the research question, findings and method, and discuss how the study fits into broader themes in the course. You will also evaluate whether (and why) you found the study compelling. Additional instructions for this paper will be distributed in class.<br />
</p>
<p><strong>Paper 2: Analytic Essay (6-8 pages) (25%)</strong>  This essay builds on the work that you will conduct in the country based pass/fail assignments. You will compare the regime type of your country case and another country in its region. You will identify a theory from class readings that could explain the similarity or differences in regime type and then will test this theory in the cases. Students will draw on course readings as well as outside research. Additional instructions for this paper will be distributed in class.<br />
</p>
<p>Students must complete all work. None of the assignments are optional.</p>
<div id="late-assignments" class="section level3">
<h3>Late Assignments</h3>
<p>All assignments are expected to be turned in on time as designated by the prompt connected with the assignment. Assignments will all be submitted via google classroom using the “turn it in” button associated with the assignment.<br />
</p>
<p>An assignment will be considered “late” if submitted after the designated deadline. In the first 24 hours after the designated deadline has passed, the assignment will receive a penalty of one-third of a letter grade (e.g. from a B to B-). Every subsequent 24 hours an assignment is late, an additional one-third penalty will be assessed. For example, if a B paper is turned in three days late, the student would receive a C.</p>
</div>
<div id="paper-grading-rubric" class="section level3">
<h3>Paper Grading Rubric</h3>
<p>A: Outstanding work. The paper shows creativity, insight, and is analytically sound. The argument is well structured and overall the paper displays a sophisticated writing style (syntax, grammar).</p>
<p>B: Good, above average work. The paper shows mastery of the main concepts and ideas, but does not necessarily synthesize them in an original form. The paper’s structure and syntax are generally fine, but there may be some writing issues present.</p>
<p>C: Average work. Shows some mastery of the main concepts and ideas, but more generally does not. There are also structure and syntax problems present.</p>
<p>D: Work reflects some effort or attempt to engage the task but is unsatisfactory as a final product, either because a key expectation of the task has been ignored or there is no evidence of mastery of the essential content.</p>
<p>F: Does not meet minimum requirements.</p>
<p>If this rubric seems unclear to you, please see me.</p>
